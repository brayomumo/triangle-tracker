#### By **Brian Mumo Paul**
## Description
This ia an application which reads the user's inputs and determines which type of triangle can be formed if the measurements are used to form a triangle. The application checks if the measurements can form an equilateral, isosceles, scalene or cannot form a a triangle.

##Behaviour Driven Development
The program should return "Values cannot be null" when any zero is entered.
Input Example:0
Output Example: Please enter a number

The program should return "Not a Triangle" when values entered don't make up a triangle.
Input Examples: 
Input 1: 2000
Input 2: 40
Input 3: 5
Output Example: Not a triangle

The program should return "Equilateral" when values entered make up an Equilateral triangle.
Input Examples: 
Input 1: 20
Input 2: 20
Input 3: 20
Output Example: Equilateral

The program should return "Isosceles" when values entered make up an Isosceles triangle.
Input Examples: 
Input 1: 20
Input 2: 20
Input 3: 10
Output Example: Isosceles

The program should return "Scalene" when values entered make up an Equilateral triangle.
Input Examples: 
Input 1: 12
Input 2: 14
Input 3: 16
Output Example: Scalene
