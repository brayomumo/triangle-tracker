# Triangle Tracker
#### This is an application which determines the type of triangle formed when a user inputs a set of measurements, 1st June,2019
#### By **Brian Mumo Paul**
## Description
This ia an application which reads the user's inputs and determines which type of triangle can be formed if the measurements are used to form a triangle. The application checks if the measurements can form an equilateral, isosceles, scalene or cannot form a a triangle.

## Behaviour Driven Development
The program should return "Values cannot be null" when zero is entered.
|sideA| sideB| sideC|  
|:--- | :---:| :---:|
|  0  |  0   |   0  | 
Output will be: values cannot be null
 
| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |
 The program should return "values cannot be null" when any zero entry is made.
 |sideA| sideB| sideC|
|-----|------|------|
|  0  |  20   |   10  | 
Output will be: values cannot be null

The program should return "Not a Triangle" when values entered don't make up a triangle.
Input Examples:
|sideA| sideB| sideC|
|-----|------|------|
|  2  |  2   |   10  | 
Output will be : Not a triangle

The program should return "Equilateral" when values entered make up an Equilateral triangle.
Input Examples:
 |sideA| sideB| sideC|
|-----|------|------|
|  20  |  20   |   20  | 
Output will be: Equilateral

The program should return "Isosceles" when values entered make up an Isosceles triangle.
Input Examples:
 |sideA| sideB| sideC|
|-----|------|------|
|  20  |  20   |   10  | 
Output will be: Isosceles 

The program should return "Scalene" when values entered make up an Equilateral triangle.
Input Examples: 
 |sideA| sideB| sideC|
|-----|------|------|
|  20  |  20   |   20  | 
Output will be: Scalene
